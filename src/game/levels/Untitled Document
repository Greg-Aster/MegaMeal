  The Fix Strategy:
  1. Delete Legacy Level Files - Remove hardcoded
  StarObservatory.ts, MirandaShip.ts
  2. Pure JSON Configuration - All levels defined only in
  configs/
  3. Isolated Scene Management - Each level clears previous
  state completely
  4. Component File Separation - Move all component logic to
  separate files
  5. Bulletproof Error Boundaries - Graceful fallbacks
  prevent cascading failures

  This approach follows your game design document perfectly -
   "Configuration Over Code" with strict separation of
  concerns where no level can affect another level's state.
