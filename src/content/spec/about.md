## Welcome to the Mega Meal Saga Universe

Step into the Mega Meal Saga, a sprawling, interconnected multiverse where dystopian fast-food empires, sentient mascots, and reality-bending cosmic entities collide. This universe is a tapestry woven from threads of cosmic horror, surrealism, and dark satire, inviting you to explore narratives that challenge perception and delve into the uncanny.

### The Genesis of Mega Meal

The Mega Meal Saga sprang from the imaginative depths of Gregory Aster, an experimental videographer and cosmic storyteller. Drawing from a background in mechanical engineering, Blender wizardry, and a fascination with the bizarre, Aster envisioned a world where the mundane (like processed food) becomes a harbinger of interdimensional terror and existential questions. The initial sparks for Mega Meal were ignited by a desire to blend genres—cyberpunk, westerns, and horror—into a unique, fragmented narrative experience.

### The Creator: Gregory Aster

Gregory Aster is the primary architect of the Mega Meal Saga Universe. His diverse skills in filmmaking, AI animation, and narrative weaving allow him to bring these complex and often unsettling visions to life. His previous work, including the vintage series DNDIY (Do-Not-Do-It-Yourself), served as a proving ground for the experimental storytelling techniques now central to Mega Meal. Aster's approach is to craft episodic, fragmented tales, offering cryptic glimpses into a larger-than-life world.
