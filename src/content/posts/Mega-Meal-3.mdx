    Immediately following the events on planet Qarnivore after the Spork Uprising.  

    Despite the incomplete transcript and unreliable nature of the narrator—there exists a single account of an encounter with the Snuggaloids that is of some scholarly interest.  

    Of particular note: the timeline between the emergence of the Snuggaloids and the extinction of the Qarnivores. It was previously assumed that there was no overlap between these two events. If this account is taken at face value and assumed correct, there may be some link between the two.
