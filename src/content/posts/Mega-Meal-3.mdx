    Immediately following the events on planet Qarnivore after the Corporate Empire.  

    Despite the incomplete transcript and unreliable nature of the narrator—there exists a single account of an encounter with the Snuggaloids that is of some scholarly interest.  

    Of particular note: the timeline between the emergence of the Snuggaloids and the extinction of the Qarnivores. It was previously assumed that there was no overlap between these two events. If this account is taken at face value and assumed correct, there may be some link between the two.

  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">This account is believed to be from the enigmatic figure mentioned in Qarnivor historical records as "<span className="text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-400" style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>(name redacted for legal reasons)</span>," whose documented visit to Qarnivor shortly after the nuclear devastation provides one of the only eyewitness accounts of the Snuggloid emergence.</p>
  
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">The narrator's description of "glowing fur" and entities that "phased in and out of visibility" aligns precisely with later scientific observations of the Snuggloids. Particularly notable is the reference to the "Starbug," which appears in several other historical accounts across different extinction events.</p>
