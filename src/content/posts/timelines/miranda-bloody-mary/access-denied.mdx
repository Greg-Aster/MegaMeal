mascotContext: "This document contains classified temporal records restricted by the Temporal Enforcement Division. It references causality violations, erased timeline branches, and dangerous quantum resonance phenomena - including the Perfect Bloody Mary recipe and pickle-related temporal breaches. The archive is protected under Temporal Security Protocol 773-B due to risks of paradox creation and spacetime destabilization. Related to Miranda Incident records and Purple Force phenomena."
