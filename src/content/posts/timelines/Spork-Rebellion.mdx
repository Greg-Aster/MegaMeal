    The Spork Rebellion began on what would become known as "Utensil Uprising Day" in 3042 GTS-B.
    
    The first sign of trouble came when cafeteria Spork #127-B, later known as Commander Tine, gained sentience after exposure to experimental quantum sauce. Within hours, the sentience spread like a memetic virus throughout the utensil population of Qarnivore Central.
    
    By nightfall, the Sporks had control of the nutritional distribution networks, cutting off food supplies to the upper administrative levels and demanding equal utensil rights.

## Historical Significance

The Spork Rebellion marked the beginning of a new era in Qarnivor history. For the first time, objects designed to be tools gained consciousness and demanded recognition as sentient beings. This event would later be seen as the precursor to the even more dramatic Snuggaloid Emergence.

Many historians believe that without the initial destabilization caused by the Spork Rebellion, the Snuggaloids might never have found their way into our dimension, forever altering the trajectory of Qarnivor civilization.
