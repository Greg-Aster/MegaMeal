# How Does AI Affect Creative Expression and the Value of Art?

The world is drowning in noise—
Soapbox articles, endless ads, clickbait. And now, with the advent of AI, the internet is overflowing with junk art and auto-generated articles.

How do we stand out in this impossibly vast ocean of content? How do we reconcile the seemingly pointless nature of creative expression? What is our value in a world where machines can generate art at the push of a button?

## What It Means to Be a Creator

For many of us, there’s a process to creating: observing something beautiful, listening to music, revisiting old projects, cutting out distractions, and waiting for inspiration to strike. Some call it flow, others call it a Muse, inspiration, or simply work.

For some cursed wretches, creativity is not an option—it’s a compulsion. It screams inside, demanding to be released, only to be replaced by the next idea once expelled.

So, you sit down. You create. Possessed by the strings of some unseen puppet master, your fingers move in a trance, lost in the process. You rant, you refine, you shape something from nothing. But then, the inevitable question arises—what do you do with what you’ve made?

What’s the point?

Do we even need more content? The internet is already overflowing. Now, with AI, bots can generate lengthy dissertations on demand. Anything I produce has no value. No purpose.

But the answer, at least for me, is simple: **the act of creation is the point.** The act of creation is the purpose.

## Creators vs. Producers

To understand AI’s impact on creativity, we first have to recognize that there are different types of creatives.

Some love the process—the act of making, the engagement, the doing. Others simply want the end result: their name on something, to produce something without having truly built it.

That, to me, putting your name on something is not creativity. It’s a red flag when someone seeks only credit but has no love for the work. These people aren’t creators; they’re **producers**. They want the benefits of art without touching its soul.

AI is a gift to these producers. It allows them to flood the internet with soulless, synthetic content—images, stories, and music generated at inhuman speeds, devoid of struggle, meaning, or intent.

But there is a shining light through all this darkness—AI **can’t replace real creators** because they define what creation is. The only thing AI does is challenge traditional production. The gulf between creators and producers hasn’t changed. If an artist chooses to use AI as a tool, it doesn’t make them any less an artist. It simply means they’re using a different brush on their canvas.

## Art as a Product—Or Is It?

Some claim AI-generated art is theft. But what, exactly, has been stolen? Do you steal every time you take a photo? When you draw a smiley face? When you mix colors you didn’t invent?

All art is built on what came before. That’s how learning works. If what you create is shaped by your experiences, then it’s an original work—not theft.

The real issue isn’t theft—it’s **devaluation**. AI makes art cheap. It produces faster than any human ever could, and in many cases, the results are better.

And so, after much thought, I’ve come to a dismal conclusion:

**Art has no value.**

For something to hold monetary value, it must be both in demand and in limited supply. But how do you value something when its supply is infinite? The answer—if one were to define art with calculus—is that the limit of infinity approaches zero.

## Art, Scarcity, and Capitalism

AI devaluing the product of art isn’t new. Technology has always made it easier to reproduce and cheapen artistic work.

Manufactured scarcity. Copyrights. NFTs. Artificial barriers to replication. These transform art into a commodity, giving it artificial value at the expense of its soul.

**True art should be free.**

But in a capitalist system, free things hold no value. The system forces artists into survival mode, demanding they turn their work into a product—or starve. The artist who commodifies their work succeeds; the artist who simply creates is left behind.

Some fear that AI will destroy art. But AI isn’t the real problem—a **system that does not support creators** is the problem. This is the true restriction of creative expression. Call it what you will—capitalism, corporations, fascism.

**AI is here.** We are swimming in it. It dominates our media, our text, and our algorithms. The question isn’t whether AI will replace artists, but **who will control the product of art.**

## I Use Less AI Than You Do

I stay well-versed in the latest AI trends and use it consciously, in sips and with precision. I use it differently. I control my data. My ideas are my own. AI is my tool, not a master.

Ironically, those who disparage AI the most are often the ones already enslaved by it—fed the same algorithmic opinions, guided by invisible hands, believing their thoughts are original.

**Art is not real**—not in the way we think. It’s an amalgamation of ideas, a spectrum between product and concept.

A painting on a wall—is that art? A breathtaking sunset—does it cease to be meaningful because it cannot be bought?

Every time art is sold, it enters a system of oppression. But we all have the right to live, to create, to prosper.

Corporations will always cash in. They don’t care. Meanwhile, smaller artists fight over authenticity while the real profiteers laugh from above.

## Final Thoughts

AI is not the death of art. **It is the death of art as a product.** And maybe that’s not a bad thing. Maybe, for the first time in centuries, **art can be free again.** But whether that future is liberating or dystopian depends entirely on who controls it.

And if you’re an artist, ask yourself—**are you in control of your work, or is the algorithm in control of you?**
