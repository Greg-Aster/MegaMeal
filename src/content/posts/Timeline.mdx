# MEGA MEAL Universe Timeline

  "Time is just one digestive tract through which all existence must pass." - Ancient Qarnivore Proverb

## The Beginning of Time

<div className="card-base p-6 mb-6">
  <h3 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-400">The Primordial Moment</h3>
  
  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">In the beginning, there was neither space nor time as we understand them. The universe existed as a singularity of infinite density and temperatureâ€”a cosmic seed containing all matter, energy, and the very essence of reality itself.</p>
  
  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">When the cosmic singularity erupted in what scientists would later call "The Big Bang," it wasn't just matter and energy that expanded outward. The fundamental forces of physics separated from their unified state, creating the first distinctions in the cosmos.</p>
  
  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">The seeds of what would one day become the quantum phenomena behind Snuggloid manifestation and spork sentience were planted in this primordial era, waiting for the right conditions to bloom into awareness.</p>

## Understanding Timeline Elements

The timeline uses several visual indicators to help you understand its contents:

<div className="card-base p-6 mb-6">
  <h4 className="font-bold text-xl mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-400">Visual Indicators</h4>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
    <li><strong>Star Nodes</strong>: Events appear as animated star-like nodes with colors indicating their era</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness and Size</strong>: Larger, brighter stars represent key events that fundamentally altered the universe</li>
    <li><strong>Glow Effects</strong>: Selected events have a distinctive glow to highlight your current focus</li>
    <li><strong>Event Cards</strong>: Information cards show details when you select an event</li>
    <li><strong>Timeline Line</strong>: The central line represents the flow of time (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile)</li>
    <li><strong>Era Badges</strong>: Colored tags indicate which historical period an event belongs to</li>
    <li><strong>Map Pins</strong>: In Map view, events with locations appear as pins on the map</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Map View Special Features

The Map view provides a spatial representation of events:

  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">A mysterious figure who appears at various points in the timeline, always in the vicinity of significant causal events. Often described as wearing a fedora and speaking in a distinctive deep, raspy voice, this entity has been documented visiting numerous extinct civilizations shortly before their collapse.</p>
  <div className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 italic">Observer Note: Surveillance footage from Quarnivor shows a fedora-wearing figure moments before the disappearance of a Starbug, visible in the lower right corner of the frame.</div>

  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">The two most evolved singularity entities in cosmic history, whose conflict across the temporal dimension reshaped causality itself. Alpha, traveling retrograde through time, collided with the forward-moving Omega at the "Convergence Nexus," triggering a war that spanned millions of years simultaneously.</p>
  <div className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-300 italic">Historical Impact: Their conflict established a new set of transtemporal constantsâ€”fundamental laws governing how causality itself operates, creating a framework that prevents such catastrophic temporal conflicts from recurring.</div>

## Timeline Anomalies and Mysteries

Not all aspects of the MEGA MEAL timeline are fully documented. Several historical mysteries remain unsolved:

1. **The Missing Week** - A seven-day period in 3043 during which all recordings and documentation from Qarnivor Central disappeared completely.

2. **The Whisper Protocols** - Referenced in multiple documents but never explained, these appear to be communication methods between early sentient utensils.

3. **Quantum Echo Events** - According to Quarnivor quantum physicists, when the universe reaches a state of perfect emptinessâ€”perfect hungerâ€”quantum fluctuations might still occur within that void. Over incomprehensible timeframes, these fluctuations could potentially coalesce into a new singularity, a new seed of reality growing from the hunger of the old. The Last Diner's final transmission, encoded in patterns of quantum decay, reportedly contained a single observation: "The hunger grows full with potential."

3. **Quantum Echo Events** - Certain evolutionary pathways, technological discoveries, and cosmic developments show statistical distributions that deviate significantly from what random chance would predict. These anomalies create a distinctive "fingerprint" that allows for the retrospective identification of time periods and phenomena subjected to retrocausal influence by future intelligences.
