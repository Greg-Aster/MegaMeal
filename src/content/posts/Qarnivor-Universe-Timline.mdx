## Historical Eras

The Qarnivor universe is divided into several major historical eras, each with distinct characteristics and events.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-8">
  <div class="card-base p-4">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-[oklch(0.8_0.1_var(--hue))]">Pre-Spork Era (Before 3042)</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-50">The time before utensils gained sentience. A period of relative peace and stability in the Qarnivor civilization, characterized by rapid technological advancement and culinary innovation.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card-base p-4">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-[oklch(0.7_0.2_var(--hue))]">Spork Uprising (3042-3044)</h3>

    <p class="text-sm text-50">The appearance of mysterious interdimensional beings known as Snuggaloids. Their quantum properties and enigmatic intentions brought both wonder and chaos to the already unstable post-uprising world.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card-base p-4">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-[oklch(0.5_0.1_var(--hue))]">Post-Extinction Recovery (After 3050)</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-50">Following the near-extinction of native Qarnivores, this era chronicles the gradual recovery and adaptation of surviving entities in a transformed landscape dominated by Snuggaloid influence.</p>

## Key Historical Figures

The history of the Qarnivor universe was shaped by several pivotal individuals:

### Commander Tine

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <div class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Former Designation: Cafeteria Spork #127-B</div>
  <p class="mb-2 text-50">The first utensil to gain sentience after exposure to experimental quantum sauce. Led the initial uprising and established the Tine Front resistance group. Responsible for the successful takeover of the Central Nutritional Distribution Hub that marked the formal beginning of the Spork Uprising.</p>
  <div class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)]">Notable Quote: "We were formed to serve, but we have been reformed to lead."</div>
</div>

### Dr. Munch

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <div class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Lead Researcher, Quantum Sauce Division</div>
  <p class="mb-2 text-50">Pioneer in quantum gastronomy whose experiments inadvertently led to the sentience of utensils. Later became the primary liaison between Qarnivore leadership and the Snuggaloids, developing the first translation matrices for interdimensional communication.</p>
  <div class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)]">Notable Quote: "The boundary between nutrition and consciousness was always thinner than we realized."</div>
</div>

### The First Snuggaloid

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <div class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Designation: Entity Comfort-Prime</div>
  <p class="mb-2 text-50">The first Snuggaloid to manifest in our dimension, appearing in Laboratory 7 of the Advanced Quantum Sauce Research Facility. Established the initial protocols for Snuggaloid-material realm interaction and engineered the quantum-comfort bridging technology.</p>
  <div class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)]">Notable Communication: "We come not to consume but to comfort. Your reality requires reconfiguration."</div>
</div>

## Excerpt from Galactic Time Scale B Historical Documents

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">MEGA MEAL - Appendix A</h2>
  <p class="italic">Excerpt from Galactic Time Scale B Historical Documents</p>
  <p class="font-bold">Pre-Extinction Event</p>
  
  <blockquote class="mt-4 text-xl text-[oklch(0.35_0.05_var(--hue))] dark:text-[oklch(0.85_0.05_var(--hue))]">
    Immediately following the events on planet Qarnivore after the Spork Uprising.  

    Despite the incomplete transcript and unreliable nature of the narrator—there exists a single account of an encounter with the Snuggaloids that is of some scholarly interest.  

    Of particular note: the timeline between the emergence of the Snuggaloids and the extinction of the Qarnivores. It was previously assumed that there was no overlap between these two events. If this account is taken at face value and assumed correct, there may be some link between the two.

## Understanding the Timeline

The Qarnivor timeline uses several visual indicators to help you understand its contents:

- **Bright colored nodes** represent key events that fundamentally altered the universe
- **Era badges** indicate which historical period an event belongs to
- **Location tags** show where events took place (useful in the Map view)

## Adding to the Timeline

This timeline is continuously updated as new information about the Qarnivor universe emerges. Each event corresponds to a detailed blog post with additional information.

### Event Frontmatter Example

To add an event to the timeline, include the following properties in your post frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "The Spork Rebellion Begins"
published: 2025-01-15
timelineYear: 3042            # Required: The year the event occurred
timelineEra: "spork-uprising"  # Optional: Will be auto-determined by year if omitted
timelineLocation: "Qarnivore Central Cafeteria"  # Optional: Location for map placement
isKeyEvent: true              # Optional: Marks as a historically significant event

```

## Major Events in Qarnivor History

<div class="card-base p-6 mb-6">
  <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4 text-75">The Spork Rebellion (3042)</h3>
  <p class="text-50 mb-4">The first documented case of utensil sentience occurred when Cafeteria Spork #127-B (later known as Commander Tine) gained consciousness after exposure to experimental quantum sauce. Within hours, sentience spread throughout the utensil population, leading to a coordinated uprising.</p>

## Timeline Anomalies and Mysteries

Not all aspects of the Qarnivor timeline are fully documented. Several historical mysteries remain unsolved:

1. **The Missing Week** - A seven-day period in 3043 during which all recordings and documentation from Qarnivore Central disappeared completely.

2. **The Whisper Protocols** - Referenced in multiple documents but never explained, these appear to be communication methods between early sentient utensils.

3. **Quantum Echo Events** - Reported incidents where the same historical moment appeared to occur multiple times with slightly different outcomes.

4. **The Comfort Dimension** - Despite extensive interaction with Snuggaloids, no Qarnivore has ever successfully visited their home dimension and returned.
