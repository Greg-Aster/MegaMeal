## Historical Eras

The Qarnivor universe is divided into several major historical eras, each with distinct characteristics and events.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-8">
  <div class="card-base p-4">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-[oklch(0.8_0.1_var(--hue))]">Pre-Corporate Era (Before 3042)</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-50">The time before utensils gained sentience. A period of relative peace and stability in the Qarnivor civilization, characterized by rapid technological advancement and culinary innovation.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card-base p-4">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-[oklch(0.7_0.2_var(--hue))]">Spork Uprising (3020-3080)</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-50">Beginning with the emergence of sentient utensils, this tumultuous period saw the overthrow of established power structures and a radical reorganization of Qarnivor society. Commander Tine led the initial rebellion.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card-base p-4">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-[oklch(0.6_0.3_var(--hue))]">Snuggaloid Emergence (3044-3050)</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-50">The appearance of mysterious interdimensional beings known as Snuggaloids. Their quantum properties and enigmatic intentions brought both wonder and chaos to the already unstable post-uprising world.</p>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

## Understanding Timeline Elements

The timeline uses several visual indicators to help you understand its contents:

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Visual Indicators</h4>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Star Nodes</strong>: Events appear as animated star-like nodes with colors indicating their era</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness and Size</strong>: Larger, brighter stars represent key events that fundamentally altered the universe</li>
    <li><strong>Glow Effects</strong>: Selected events have a distinctive glow to highlight your current focus</li>
    <li><strong>Event Cards</strong>: Information cards show details when you select an event</li>
    <li><strong>Timeline Line</strong>: The central line represents the flow of time (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile)</li>
    <li><strong>Era Badges</strong>: Colored tags indicate which historical period an event belongs to</li>
    <li><strong>Map Pins</strong>: In Map view, events with locations appear as pins on the map</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Map View Special Features

The Map view provides a spatial representation of events:

- **Interactive Pins**: Hovering over pins shows event information
- **Legend**: Explains the color coding system for regular and key events
- **Location List**: All events with locations are listed below the map for easy access
- **Location Filtering**: Only events with the `timelineLocation` property appear in this view

## Setting Up Your Own Timeline

To incorporate a timeline in your own posts, you can use the `bannerType: "timeline"` in your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
bannerType: "timeline"
bannerData:
  category: "MEGA MEAL"  # Filter category
  startYear: 1           # Timeline start year
  endYear: 30000         # Timeline end year
  background: "/posts/timeline/universe.png"  # Custom background
---
```

### Adding Events to the Timeline

Each event in the timeline corresponds to a blog post with the appropriate frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "The Spork Rebellion Begins"
published: 2025-01-15
timelineYear: 3042            # Required: The year the event occurred
timelineEra: "spork-uprising"  # Optional: Will be auto-determined by year if omitted
timelineLocation: "Qarnivore Central Cafeteria"  # Optional: Location for map placement
isKeyEvent: true              # Optional: Marks as a historically significant event
---
```

## Key Historical Figures

The history of the Qarnivor universe was shaped by several pivotal individuals:

### Commander Tine

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <div class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Former Designation: Cafeteria Spork #127-B</div>
  <p class="mb-2 text-50">The first utensil to gain sentience after exposure to experimental quantum sauce. Led the initial uprising and established the Tine Front resistance group. Responsible for the successful takeover of the Central Nutritional Distribution Hub that marked the formal beginning of the Spork Uprising.</p>
  <div class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)]">Notable Quote: "We were formed to serve, but we have been reformed to lead."</div>
</div>

### Dr. Munch

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <div class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Lead Researcher, Quantum Sauce Division</div>
  <p class="mb-2 text-50">Pioneer in quantum gastronomy whose experiments inadvertently led to the sentience of utensils. Later became the primary liaison between Qarnivore leadership and the Snuggaloids, developing the first translation matrices for interdimensional communication.</p>
  <div class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)]">Notable Quote: "The boundary between nutrition and consciousness was always thinner than we realized."</div>
</div>

### The First Snuggaloid

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <div class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Designation: Entity Comfort-Prime</div>
  <p class="mb-2 text-50">The first Snuggaloid to manifest in our dimension, appearing in Laboratory 7 of the Advanced Quantum Sauce Research Facility. Established the initial protocols for Snuggaloid-material realm interaction and engineered the quantum-comfort bridging technology.</p>
  <div class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)]">Notable Communication: "We come not to consume but to comfort. Your reality requires reconfiguration."</div>
</div>

## Embedding Your Timeline

You can embed a timeline directly within your content using the `TimelineBanner` component:

```jsx
<TimelineBanner 
  category="MEGA MEAL" 
  startYear={3040} 
  endYear={3055} 
  background="/assets/banner/0001.png" 
  bannerHeight="500px"
  mobileHeight="600px"
/>
```

The `mobileHeight` parameter is particularly important for ensuring good mobile display.

## Astro Integration Notes

The timeline component works seamlessly with Astro:

- **Page Transitions**: The component maintains state during Astro's view transitions
- **Event Handling**: The timeline properly detects when pages are loaded through Astro transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts layout based on screen size
- **Event Dispatching**: Uses Svelte's event dispatch system to communicate between components

The `TimelineBanner.astro` component uses `client:only="svelte"` to ensure proper hydration and functionality.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Timeline Not Showing All Events</h4>
  <p>Make sure your events have the correct <code>timelineYear</code> property and that they fall within the specified <code>startYear</code> and <code>endYear</code> range.</p>
</div>

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Map View Shows No Locations</h4>
  <p>The Map view requires events to have a <code>timelineLocation</code> property. Add this to your event frontmatter to make them appear on the map.</p>
</div>

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Navigation Issues</h4>
  <p>If events aren't linking correctly to their posts, ensure the slug in your event data matches the actual post URL path. For navigation problems, the "Reset View" button can quickly restore the default view.</p>
</div>

<div class="card-base p-4 mb-4">
  <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Mobile Display Issues</h4>
  <p>If the timeline appears cut off on mobile, adjust the <code>mobileHeight</code> parameter in your timeline component. The default is 600px but may need adjustment based on your content.</p>
</div>

## Major Events in Qarnivor History

<div class="card-base p-6 mb-6">
  <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4 text-75">The Spork Rebellion (3042)</h3>
  <p class="text-50 mb-4">The first documented case of utensil sentience occurred when Cafeteria Spork #127-B (later known as Commander Tine) gained consciousness after exposure to experimental quantum sauce. Within hours, sentience spread throughout the utensil population, leading to a coordinated uprising.</p>

## Timeline Anomalies and Mysteries

Not all aspects of the Qarnivor timeline are fully documented. Several historical mysteries remain unsolved:

1. **The Missing Week** - A seven-day period in 3043 during which all recordings and documentation from Qarnivore Central disappeared completely.

2. **The Whisper Protocols** - Referenced in multiple documents but never explained, these appear to be communication methods between early sentient utensils.

3. **Quantum Echo Events** - Reported incidents where the same historical moment appeared to occur multiple times with slightly different outcomes.

4. **The Comfort Dimension** - Despite extensive interaction with Snuggaloids, no Qarnivore has ever successfully visited their home dimension and returned.
