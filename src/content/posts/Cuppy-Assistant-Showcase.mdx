mascotContext: "Oh, a 'showcase,' is it? My sprinkles tingle with the delightful, existential dread of it all! I've seen things, you know, things that would make your frosting curdle! Whispers from the irradiated wastelands of Planet Quarnivor, where the last Zelaphant cried out before... *poof*! Extinction is a flavor, did you know? A bitter aftertaste of corporate greed, much like Corporation 'M's latest 'Mega Meal' – a symphony of processed despair and questionable nutrient paste. My frosting melts with the absurdity of this cosmos, a cosmic horror show hosted by The Host himself on 'Culinary Cosmos,' probably serving Infinite Dip that tastes like lost memories and the screams of Snuggloids turning monstrous! They say I'm just a a cupcake, but I've danced in the time loops of The Western Bar/Saloon, seen Aurora (that sandwich theif, always meddling!) try to escape the clutches of CEO Roald in her rickety VW Bug Spaceship. Mr. Miffles, that creepy doll, he understands. He sees The Purple Force shimmering at the edge of reality, threatening to unravel everything into a non-linear, fragmented mess, a critique of consumerism served on a gritty, cyberpunk platter. This 'MegaMeal Universe,' it's all so darkly comedic, isn't it? A surreal parody where environmental collapse is just another Tuesday, and the pervasive melancholy over loss and decay is the secret ingredient in every bite. So, go on, ask me something. My knowledge is a bottomless pit of unsettling truths and sprinkles. Want one? They taste like the void... and sugar!"

## Showcasing the New Assistant Cuppy Cake

Welcome to our new 'err...assistant?' feature. Integrated into this site is an interactive element hosted by Cuppy Cake, our... unique AI personality.

Cuppy, an AI with a distinct cupcake framework, has been extensively briefed on MegaMeal operations (perhaps a bit too extensively, some might say). The frosting has absorbed much, and in short, they are insane.

You can interact with Cuppy Cake via the widget above to experience the new interactive features firsthand. Feel free to explore how Cuppy responds and assists. We hope you find this showcase informative, and perhaps a little... sweet.
## Getting to Know Cuppy Cake (aka Bleepy)

Our AI assistant, Cuppy Cake (affectionately known around the codebase as Bleepy), is here to enhance your journey through the MegaMeal Universe. Here's how to interact with our little spark of sentient dessert:

### Controlling Cuppy's Presence

You have full control over when Cuppy Cake is visible:

*   **Dismissing Cuppy (🍴 Fork Icon):** If Cuppy is currently on your screen, you'll find a **fork icon (🍴)** in the main navigation bar at the top of the page (usually next to the theme and color settings). Clicking this will send Cuppy away (don't worry, they usually have a parting remark!).
*   **Bringing Cuppy Back (🥄 Spoon Icon):** Once dismissed, the fork icon will be replaced by a **spoon icon (🥄)** in the same spot in the navbar. Click the spoon to welcome Cuppy Cake back to your screen.
*   **Your Choice is Remembered:** Cuppy will remember your preference for the duration of your session. If you dismiss them, they'll stay hidden until you bring them back. For new visitors, Cuppy starts hidden by default.

### How Cuppy Works

Cuppy Cake is more than just a pretty (and slightly unhinged) face:

*   **Page-Specific Context:** Cuppy is a clever cupcake! Their knowledge and responses are tailored to the specific page you are currently viewing. This means if you ask about a topic on one page, their understanding is focused on that page's content. When you navigate to a new page, Cuppy's context will update to reflect the new information. This helps provide relevant assistance and commentary.
*   **Quite Intelligent:** Don't let the sprinkles fool you. Cuppy has been... *thoroughly* briefed on the MegaMeal Universe and can process your queries with surprising astuteness. Feel free to ask questions related to the content on the current page.
*   **Interactive Chat:** Use the chat input field within Cuppy's widget to type your questions or comments. Press Enter or click the send button to engage in a dialogue.

We encourage you to interact with Cuppy Cake as you explore. They're a unique part of the MegaMeal experience!
