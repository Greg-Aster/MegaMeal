# Navigating the AI Age of Art

There has been a shift in culture recently, and now AI is everywhere. We are talking about it constantly. It seems everywhere I turn, people are polarized and fired up about it. But truthfully—whether for or against—you use AI every day, constantly. …and at the same time, AI isn’t real.

The swimming in AI I refer to is our phones, map navigation, texting, media feeds, TV, ads, and more. There is no escape. We are drowning—and to survive in this sea, you must understand how to use AI to be empowered and navigate the world. To understand this, you must understand that AI isn’t real. It’s just another tool.

With new things, there is alaway turmoil. AI is no different - people are upset. Torches and pitchforks are raised, fingers pointing, and accusations of “witch” abound. I find all this really unfortunate and hope the turmoil dies down—but my heels are dug in, and I'm ready for the long haul.

Unfortunately, this seems to be a generational divide. Younger people embrace the new technology, while older generations lament the “good old days.” It’s nothing new. We saw it with painters and cameras, horses and cars, practical effects and computer graphics.

## Let’s Deal with the Preconceptions

**Q. Is AI actually Artificial Intelligence?**  
No. AI cannot think. If AI could think, then it would be real “AI.” What people generally call “AI” is just a branding term for statistical models called “neural networks” (which is another branding term). These models can get extremely complex—so much so that it’s difficult to differentiate between AI-generated content and human-created work. Despite this, any “AI” generated work you see on the internet has a human behind it.

**Q. Is AI art theft?**  
No, not inherently. AI can’t steal any more than a paintbrush or a camera can. However, AI art, with its complex tools and abilities to mimic, can be used to steal and deceive. Just like any tool, it is possible be used for good and bad. The stories of theft make great headlines, so fear and anger have been misdirected at the machines rather than the people abusing them. The true thieves are the ones using AI to mimic and deceive—not any user, and certainly not the technology itself. 

**Q. Will AI take my job?**  
Yes! If it hasn’t already taken your job, it probably will—or at least impact it severely. To understand this, we only need to look at history - I will use the Industrial Revolution for analogy. For example, many poor children became unemployed when child labor was no longer a thing. Those kids needed those jobs to survive, eat, and pay the rent…what will they do…?

So, what can we do about the robots taking our jobs? Luddites tried to do something—famously, they destroyed the factory machines during the Industrial Revolution. They became symbolic of technological resistance and eventually got enshrined in language as someone incompetent with technology.

With machines being able to produce art cheaply—and in some cases better and faster than the artist—what do we do? The answer to this question is nothing new: control the machines that produce better and faster. Be on top of the wave rather than crushed underneath it.

## How Does AI Affect Creative Expression and the Value of Art?

How do we stand out in this impossibly vast ocean of content? How do we reconcile the seemingly pointless nature of creative expression? What is our value in a world where machines can generate art at the push of a button? The answer…is to be free.

If you’re asking this question in the first place, you are thinking like a content-creating capitalist and not an artist. When you create true art, it’s not about the product or the scarcity—it’s about the expression and intent. You should be making something because you want to, because it is beautiful, because it deserves to exist. The medium it was made with should matter to the artist. If you produce because you want to commodify something, you are a producer. If you’re worried or upset that you can’t sell something that can be produced indefinitely and desire to stop this flow, you're no different than a book-banning authoritarian. People who produce only to sell let internalized capitalism govern their work, and they are slaves to a system that is trying to discard them.

Imagine a Star Trek food replicator—did chefs cry and lament because they lost their jobs? In that utopian vision, they didn’t. No one went hungry, either. Cooking became a choice rather than a necessity. The real problem we face isn’t AI or automation—it’s capitalism. We’re thinking about art as a commodity, and we can’t commodify something that has no scarcity. The unfortunate side effect of this is that artists go hungry in a system that values only what is scarce, and digital media can be replicated infinitely.

With the advent of AI, scarcity is no longer a thing. You no longer have to be beautiful, you no longer have to cry and suffer for something—you can just, at the flick of a wrist, have anything you want. We should really be making art not because we need more content in this world. Having no value attached to art is actually a boon. It allows someone to create without restriction. In the end, individuals who rely on selling themselves or relying on other people for validation are losing their power and are upset. If you determine that there’s something in this world that is missing for you, something that you want—whether it is a finished product or simply enjoying the act of creation—then make that thing. That is independence and power. The medium doesn’t matter. The medium is just a means, a tool. Tools will always change—but creation is timeless. True creators don’t get lost in the arms race—they simply make.

AI can’t replace real creators because they define what creation is. The only thing AI does is challenge traditional production. The gulf between creators and producers hasn’t changed. If an artist chooses to use AI as a tool, it doesn’t make them any less of an artist. It simply means they’re using a different brush on their canvas.

True art should be free.

## Final Thoughts

AI is not a threat to art, but it is a threat to art as a product. And maybe that’s not a bad thing. Maybe, without value attached to it, art can be free and accessible to people without means. Don’t restrict or cut out people who enjoy these things. This divide is putting you on the wrong side of history. Look to the future—whether that future is liberating or dystopian depends entirely on who controls it. So, ride the wave, understand it. If you don’t like the medium, don’t judge someone who does. If you want less AI, put down that phone, stop typing, don’t use a map. Instead, look around, get lost, talk to someone real, paint, dance in the forest, enjoy a sunset—and if you’re an artist, consider having a conversation in the mirror. Ask yourself questions about why you do what you do—questions about value, personal expression, and what freedom to make whatever you want without restriction means.
