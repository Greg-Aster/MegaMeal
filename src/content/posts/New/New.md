Hello!

With the general hellscape of the internet, social media, and the world at large, I figured it was wise to create a central repository for my content. This is day one. There will be more features, updates, and posts to come.

Who is Gregory Aster?
Gregory Aster is a filmmaker, animator, and storyteller with a penchant for the bizarre, the experimental, and the deeply nostalgic. He spent 23 years as a mechanic 10 as a certified technician and manager, then 13 as a business owner - he retired from the trade and dove headfirst into the world of creative media.

His work blends cyberpunk, cosmic horror, and absurdist humor, drawing inspiration from old-school sci-fi, westerns, and the strange corners of pop culture. From dystopian fast-food conspiracies to interdimensional smugglers, his projects thrive on mystery, aesthetic weirdness, and an undercurrent of melancholy.

Greg has experience in local TV production, contract videography, and a lifetime of hands-on problem-solving. He is fluent in Blender, works with ComfyUI for AI-assisted animation, and experiments with the latest, cutting edge video tools. When he's not crafting surreal narratives, he's either running, learning French, or considering a side quest into trucking.

This website is where all of that comes togetherâ€”a home for projects, ideas, and whatever else comes next. Stay tuned.
