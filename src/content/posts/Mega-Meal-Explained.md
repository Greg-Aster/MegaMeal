## Mega Meal Explained **<span style="color: blue;">*Medium Size*</em></span>**
Its a fake movie trailer - a parody of over-the-top films. A mysterious character *(redacted for legal reasons)* is introduced in a cyberpunk city filled with holographic fast-food ads and corporate dystopia. The protagonist, clad in prison stripes and a fedora, exudes femme fatale energy as a deep, raspy voiceover narrates.

The trailer teases a world of intrigue, rebellion, and fast-food capitalism. It’s cheesy, self-aware, and exactly what you’d expect if your favoris fast food mascots became sentient horrors in a future dystopin world.  

The world these characters inhabit is dense and layered - like a delicious Froozie Shake. Don’t expect to catch every reference. It’s meal-messy, questionable, but oddly satisfying if you’re in the right mood.

## Mega Meal Explained **<span style="color: red;">*ULTRA Size*</em></span>**  

The videos first few seconds are black. You hear a blaring siren. Then a moody reveal: a dark rainy night, a maximum-security prison looming in the background, barbed wire, and water. Searchlights sweep the landscape, suggesting an escape. Text zooms in, setting our expectations: this is a parody trailer. The view transitions to a bustling futuristic dystopian megalopolis, seen from above. Holographic fast-food ads flash from skyscrapers as the music builds.  

A shot of legs walking slowly down a rainy alleyway teases a mysterious femme fatale. A deep, raspy voiceover kicks in, expressing hunger and desire. The camera pans over grimy streets and rundown restaurants. Finally, the backside of a provocatively dressed stranger - prison stripes, fedora, yellow gloves - walks among the crowds. A dramatic title slams onto the screen, punctuated by an explosion. It pauses a moment for the viewer to take it all in.

The view returns to the city, now showing a mysterious CEO in a yellow jacket with a red afro, sitting in a position of power - overlooking his crumbling urban empire. Words, titles, and fake movie reviews pan over the scenes, insinuating that other humans have seen this, so you should too.  

Next, we see the mysterious character again, standing next to a well-lit billboard with her face on it: *Wanted*. From the shadows, a male figure watches—a subtle nod to the character’s origins and her bold, audacious nature.

### Next Scenes  

An establishing shot of the giant corporate headquarters of the W Corporation leads into an empty, closed-down restaurant with a playplace. A sign pulls into focus: *No Adults in the Ball Pit*. A low, wide shot of the restaurant from the ball pit’s perspective reveals a head with a hat slowly rising out of the balls. The music cues mystery and humor.  

A security guard walks down a hallway full of mannequins. The (**redacted for legal reasons**) stands among them, absolutely still, blending in. The guard walks by, unaware. The (**redacted for legal reasons**) breaks the fourth wall and winks at the camera.  

Next, a lab with a vault door labeled *Secret Recipe*. Tension builds as we approach the door, then all go black. The music changes, A hamburger is sealed in a container, and a yellow-gloved hand reaches in, slowly pulling it out. The song has cool tropical vibes, playing as the scene fades out.  

The next scene sweeps in - everything is tropical, warm tones, colorful, and vibrant. Fat well fed men in shorts do celebratory dances. The (**redacted for legal reasons**) reveals her face for the first time, no longer in disguise. She’s dancing too, happy. ...until the camera zooms in on the *Secret Recipe* hamburger. It has a face and is screaming in terror. A surprise twist: things aren’t always as they seem.

### The Climax  

An ominous drone noise hits, and sinister music rushes in. Fast-food parody characters from different franchises arrive in a shock-and-awe tactic, pulling back the curtains to reveal a much bigger world—a futuristic floating fortress shaped like a king’s crown. The king’s army of supersoldiers, clad in gold with energized baton scepters and red capes, marches forward in formation. A low-angle shot suggests dominance and power.  

A high view of the (**redacted for legal reasons**) overlooking the city symbolizes a hero’s journey: conflict, understanding, responsibility, hope, inspiration, adversity, perseverance, and sacrifice. A counter-shot shows a dark factory with an interdimensional portal. Fast-food wrappers whip around as Wendi, a doll with glowing eyes, blocks the portal with a suggestion of supernatural abilities.  

The city descends into chaos. Reality fractures. A rooster in a meat locker holds a meat cleaver. A billboard advertises a new product: *The Infinite Dip*. Children wander dark streets like zombies, suggesting a mind-altering substance and cravings beyond control.  

Sexy man butts. Weird, unappetizing food. Sentient mayo merges and begins to take over the city. A giant purple *thing* (what is it supposed to be, anyway?) Jak Sawce accidentally kills his opponent in a match. Living mannequins as food servers. The chickens rise up. The mayo grows. Terrorism. Explosions. Restaurants are filled with dancing, intelligent cockroaches. Burgers twitch in the streets like mimics in disguise.  

The streets flood. The Hamburgler is gone. Perhaps it was all a dream? We take a breath, and we’re back on a building. The Hamburgler overlooks the city. It’s time to act. Take up the mantle. Fight back.  

She dives into the action, falling and falling, and falling and falling, and falling. as reality shifts around her. She begins running faster and faster, no more feme fetale saunter - this time with purpose. A final shot reveals the CEO of W Corporation in his office—a clown. Storm clouds gather, and his face turns sinister. Then, the *Mega Meal* logo hits, punctuated by an explosion. A teaser says it will be released in 2066—an indication it may never happen. 

A Surprise final outro at a fast-food drive-through features a demonic voice saying, *No pickles*. Then, black.

## Final Thoughts  

The video takes the form of a movie trailer for a film that doesn’t exist. This format allows the creator to move the plot forward at a breakneck pace, introducing a world and storyline that leave room for further episodes.  

In this world, the (**redacted for legal reasons**) character is clad in a bikini with prison stripes—a distinctive getup that’s not intended to sexualize her but is a nod to other characters and numerous tropes in different series and films, but reimagined with a strong female protagonist.  

The video’s quality is “fair,” with many glitches and imperfections. While it’s possible to hyper-focus on quality and create a seamless product, the labor involved as a solo creator makes that nearly impossible. Compromises were made to keep the project moving forward.  

Ultimately, the project suffers from the same issues as any indie production: **budget, labor, and audience**. Larger studios have entire teams—writers, directors, artists, marketers, and equipment at the ready. A single creator working at this scale is bound to hit limits.  

In that sense, what’s been achieved so far is impressive, but will the series continue? Hopefully, but I’ve been down this road before. Breaking down the labor problem is like attempting to summit an impossibly high mountain with no oxygen. There’s no support system here, and the project will likely die, emaciated and forgotten, in some dark alley. The world at large won’t even notice its sad end. Friends will step over its mummified corpse barely looking down, as they prefer the work of strangers, while people they know, sit alone, slowly sinking into poverty, waiting for the last nail in the coffin to be hammered in. 

Onward into the dark rainny night, we continue pushing forward.  

Fries or Onion Rings?
