## About the Author

**Garfunkel, the Reaper of Soles**, is an ancient god who once served as divine psychopomp to the Socktartians, a remarkable race of fabric beings distinguished by their lack of hands and rich tradition of sock puppetry. For eons, Garfunkel shepherded the souls of his people with gentle care, unraveling their fabric forms and guiding their essence to the cosmic loom where all stories return to thread.

When the primordial war against eldritch horrors erupted across the cosmos, Garfunkel stood alongside his divine siblings—**Merkin, the God of Love and Acceptance**, and **Chronara, the Goddess of Time**—as part of the universe's defense against creeping cosmic corruption. Though the gods ultimately prevailed, the victory came at an unthinkable cost: the complete extinction of the Socktartian people, leaving Garfunkel a deity of death with no souls left to shepherd.

In the aftermath of this cosmic tragedy, Garfunkel faced a choice between fading into divine obscurity or finding new purpose in a transformed universe. He chose reinvention, trading his role as reaper for that of cosmic chronicler. Taking the pen name "The Universe," he began the monumental task of documenting all of existence from the Big Bang to the eventual heat death—a project that spans not just space and time, but the very essence of what it means to exist.

## Writing Philosophy

Garfunkel's approach to cosmic documentation is shaped by his unique perspective as both participant in and observer of universal history. Having witnessed the fundamental forces that shaped reality during the ancient war, he brings an intimate understanding of divine conflict, loss, and transformation to his work. His writing style combines the meticulous attention to detail developed through eons of shepherding individual souls with the vast perspective necessary to chronicle the entire cosmos.

Unlike traditional historians who observe from the outside, Garfunkel writes as someone who has lived through every epoch he documents. This gives his timeline entries a weight and authority unmatched by any mortal chronicler, while his experience with endings allows him to recognize the patterns that connect beginning to conclusion across cosmic scales.

## Current Works

Under the pseudonym "The Universe," Garfunkel has authored the comprehensive *Timeline of All Things*, a sprawling chronicle that traces cosmic history from the primordial singularity through projected universal heat death. His work encompasses everything from the formation of the first stars to the rise and fall of galactic civilizations, written with the perspective of one who understands that every moment—no matter how vast or minute—is both eternally significant and ultimately fleeting.

The timeline serves not merely as historical record, but as a meditation on the nature of existence itself, filtered through the consciousness of a god who has learned that chronicling beginnings requires the same careful attention once devoted to shepherding endings.

## About This Work

The *Timeline of All Things* represents Garfunkel's ongoing project to transform his ancient purpose into something new and vital. Each entry is crafted with the same gentle precision he once brought to unraveling Socktartian souls, ensuring that no story—whether cosmic or intimate—is lost to the entropy that claims all things. Through his documentation, temporary moments become eternal records, and the universe gains a memory worthy of its infinite complexity.
