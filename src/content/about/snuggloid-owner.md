## The Consumer

The individual listed as "A Registered Snuggloid Owner" was a typical Qarnivor resident who purchased three commercial Snuggloid companions during the product's popular marketing period. Consumer records show they owned models SG-4471, SG-9982, and SG-2156, rating their experience positively and participating in online owner communities.

Social media archives reveal they were an enthusiastic customer who shared care tips and photos of their pets. Their posts demonstrate the typical attachment Qarnivor residents formed with the marketed "comfort companions," treating them as beloved pets rather than simple consumer products.

## The Disappearance

The individual vanished approximately six months before Qarnivor's nuclear exchange, during a period when many residents were fleeing the escalating conflict. Their disappearance was initially unremarkableâ€”thousands of people left the planet as tensions between the Pro-Spoon and Anti-Spoon factions intensified.

However, their case differs from typical evacuations in that no transportation records exist for their departure, and their residence was found fully furnished with no signs of hurried packing. Most notably, their three Snuggloid pets also disappeared, despite no evidence of pet evacuation services.

Their final social media post read: "The Snugs are acting strange tonight. They keep looking at the sky."

## Missing Person Status

The individual remains listed as Missing Person #QN-7749 in galactic databases. Their case is among thousands from the pre-extinction period when Qarnivor residents fled or disappeared during the civil conflict.

Notably, at least 47 other registered Snuggloid owners also vanished during the same timeframe under similar circumstancesâ€”leaving behind fully furnished homes with no evacuation records. This pattern of disappearances among Snuggloid owners specifically has drawn minor research attention, though no definitive explanation has been established.

The case gained additional interest following the post-extinction emergence of mysterious entities that bear resemblance to commercial Snuggloid products, though any connection remains purely speculative. The individual's whereabouts remain unknown, and they are presumed dead along with most of Qarnivor's population.

## Database Entry

The case remains open in missing persons databases, though active investigation has been suspended due to the planet's quarantine status and the passage of time since the disappearance. Standard missing person protocols apply, with identity protection maintained per galactic privacy directives.

*Missing Person #QN-7749's case file is accessible through the [Qarnivor Missing Persons Database](/posts/timeline/snuggloids-commercial/) along with thousands of other unresolved disappearances from the pre-extinction period.*
